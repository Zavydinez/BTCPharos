## BTCPharos - Bitcoin-Backed Lending Protocol

BTCPharos is a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol built on the **Stacks blockchain**, enabling over-collateralized Bitcoin-backed loans with programmable smart contracts written in **Clarity**.

Users can lock Bitcoin as collateral and receive a stablecoin or other assets as a loan, based on their collateral ratio. Liquidation mechanisms protect lenders, while interest rate enforcement and maximum durations ensure platform stability.
